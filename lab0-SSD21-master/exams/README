EXAM 3:
I wrote in the pdf but after I saved the pdf, it was empty. I tried other methods to fill in the pdf but it seems the document is locked and i can't save it with the changes. However, i have uploaded the screenshots of my answer. I would really appreciate if you could consider it. Also this has been brought into Dana's notice.
